# Enigma
Enigma machine, because why not.

# enigma.js
enigma.js has a smattering of code that effectively lays out the encoding/decoding process of an Enigma machine. It doesn't *work*, per se, as there's no way to provide inputs or display outputs; it's just a framework that can be used in other projects.

# esprigma.js
esprigma.js is enigma.js applied, specifically within the [Sprig]([url](https://sprig.hackclub.com/)) game creator. It includes a sort of tutorial where the user encodes and decodes a few messages, gradually introducing the mechanics of the Enigma machine. A link to the game on the Sprig website will be made available once it has been processed and accepted.
